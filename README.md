# Emulator-Manager-Resources

A repository to host the resources required by my [Emulator Manager](https://github.com/Viren070/Emulator-Manager).
Emulator Manager can download and install the latest firmware files for ryujinx or yuzu. It can also install yuzu (early access too) and ryujinx and keep them updated. 
It also supports Dolphin and ROMs can be downloaded through it for Dolphin.
